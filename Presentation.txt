Presentation.txt


We don't give birth to a matured product, that's hard, instead we have a vision of what/who/where (www) are in the future. 
This vision is in the DNA of our product which will grow and evolve at the heart beat of each sprint.

DevOps is in the center of this organic entity, connecting creativity and mobility in order to deliver the developed elements of this vision.

In a demanding times we need systems that scales on-demand. While there are many solutions to the same problem we should not forget to keep things stupid simple by reducing waste so we have a clean, lean and efficient platform.
